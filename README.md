# React + Vite Minimal Starter

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and some pre-configured ESLint rules for code quality.

## 🔧 Features

- ⚡ **Vite** for lightning-fast development and build performance
- ⚛️ **React** with modern JSX support
- 🔄 **HMR (Hot Module Replacement)** out of the box
- 🧹 **ESLint** preconfigured for consistent code style

## 🛠 What We're Building

This project goes beyond the basic setup—our goal is to build a **fully functional website UI** with:

- 🧱 Reusable and modular React components
- 💾 **localStorage** integration for client-side data persistence
- 🗂 Structured and scalable folder organization
- 🎨 Optional: Custom styling with Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, or your preferred method
